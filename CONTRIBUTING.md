# Contributing to the Solid Docs

We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level. As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors. We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

> **Tip for new contributors:**
> Take a look at [this GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) to learn how to use Git and GitHub to contribute to open-source.


## Getting Started

Our `#docs` channel on Discord is our home for general docs discussion. Feel free to introduce yourself there!

[Submit a new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/issues/new/choose) to propose a change or addition to the docs.

Bugs must be reported as Issues; it isn't enough to tell us on Discord! 

GitHub Issues allow us to assign tasks and prioritize them, thanks to our [GitHub project board](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/projects/1). This is our task management tool.

Because this project is new, most of our Issues represent new content that must be created. If you're interested in writing new content—or editing content to our standards—be sure to read the [Writing Guide](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md) before contributing.

### Do you need to know Solid to contribute?

In short, no! Here are ways you can help us if you don't yet know how to use Solid:

- Editing existing content for clarity
- Finding and fixing typos
- Making sure existing content and proposed PRs follow our [Writing Guide](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md)

If you don't _yet_ know how to use Solid, but you're learning, here's how you can help us along the way:
- "Testing" a tutorial, how-to guide, or concept page by using it to learn that topic
- Asking and answering questions in our #learn-solid channel on [Discord](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)

That said, if you want to contribute to open-source but aren't interested in Solid or documentation, we'd be happy to help you find an open-source project that suits you.

## Finding something to work on

To find something to help with, check out our [existing Issues](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/issues). You can sort by labels, which categorize the issues.

We have a label for each [Content Type](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/issues). For example, you know you prefer to work on deep concept explanations, you can choose the `concept` label.

We use the `new content` label when something needs to be written from scratch, and `docs-migration` when content already exists but needs to be rewritten.

- Before you make a new feature / content PR, try to discuss it with other docs contributors on #docs! This will make sure we're on the same page and increase the chance of your PR getting merged.



Submitting an Issue is usually the first step to making a change. After an Issue has been considered by the community, we often reach out to community members to encourage them to submit PRs based on existing Issues.

Larger contributions to the docs are encouraged after consultation, as unsolicited material may not fit into our existing plans. 

> Tip: Existing PRs and Issues need reviewing, triaging, and feedback, too! You can make valuable contributions by commenting, suggesting, testing, researching, brainstorming and generally helping in all areas on GitHub!
