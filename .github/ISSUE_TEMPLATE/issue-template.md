A good issue contains

- A description of the problem (or new content/feature). If you can, include where the problem is in the repository.
- An explanation as to why this is a problem, or why this content/feature should be added. Ideally, explain _who_ is affected by this.
- A suggestion of a path forward, if you have one in mind!
- If suggesting a new content page, make sure to explain which [content type](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md#content-types) the page should be.
