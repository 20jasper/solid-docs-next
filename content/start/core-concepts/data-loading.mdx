# Data Loading

One of the primary features of SolidStart is simplifying interactions with the server to get data into components. When you follow these conventions, SolidStart can automatically:

- Server render your pages
- Be resilient to network conditions when JavaScript fails to load
- Make optimizations as the user interacts with your site to make it fast by only loading data for the changing parts of the page
- Fetch data, JavaScript modules, CSS and other assets in parallel on transitions, avoiding render+fetch waterfalls that lead to choppy UI
- Ensure the data in the UI is in sync with the data on the server by revalidating after [actions][action]
- Excellent scroll restoration on back/forward clicks (even across domains)
- Handle server side errors with [error boundaries][error-boundary]
- Enable solid UX for "Not Found" and "Unauthorized" with [catch boundaries][catch-boundary]
- Help you keep the happy path of your UI happy.

## Basics

Each [route module][route-module] can export a component and a [`routeData`](routedata) function. [`useRouteData`](useroutedata) will provide exactly what the `routeData` function returns to your component:

```tsx {1-3,5-10,13}
import { RouteDataArgs, useRouteData } from "solid-start";

export const routeData = async (args: RouteDataArgs) => {
  return [
    { id: "1", name: "Pants" },
    { id: "2", name: "Jacket" },
  ];
};

export default function Products() {
  const products = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <For each={products}>
        {(product) => <div key={product.id}>{product.name}</div>}
      </For>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Normally, you would want to do something asyncronous to load your data from your datasources. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API. Here we would like to introduce you to `createServerData`, SolidStart's data-loading primitive. This is mainly intended for apps with SSR. If you are not using SSR, you can learn how to use `createRouteData`. They are wrappers around Solid's `createResource` but integrate with the rest of the framework to help us provide an excellent UX out-of-the-box. Here's what they bring to the table:

- Manage refreshing data on navigation under transitions to provide a user experience similar to the browser on navigations, i.e we hold the current page and data until the new one arrives
- Use the source as a `key` that can be used to refetch the resource manually
- Handle redirects from the fetcher/server
- Integrate with Suspense for `loading` states and waiting on the server for SSR
- With `createServerData` you can:

  - Access server-side only APIs like the database in the middle of your app code
  - A compiled, typesafe remote procedure call mechanism without thinking about API endpoints or function ids, just write a function wrapped in `createServerData`, we will take care of it
  - Handle server-side errors with ErrorBoundaries
  - Keep server-side code out of the client bundle
  - Get access to the `PageEvent` object for getting more information about the `Request`, eg. Headers, etc.

`createServerData` and `createRouteData` share the same signature and are both meant to be used in similar places. The difference is that `createServerData` ensures that the fetcher function is going to only ever be run on the server. The compiler ensures that the fetcher as well as any code and dependencies it uses will never be shipped to the client. This makes it safe to use server-only for APIs and SDKs for things like database, payment processing, content management systems, etc. But allows you to write code exactly where you need it.

```tsx
import { useRouteData } from "solid-start";
import { createServerData } from "solid-start/server";
import db from "~/db";

export function routeData({ params }: RouteDataArgs) {
  return {
    repositories: createServerData(
      () => params.userId,
      async (userId) => {
        return await db.getRespositories(userId);
      }
    ),
    organizations: createServerData(
      () => params.userId,
      async (userId) => {
        return await db.getOrganizations(userId);
      }
    ),
  };
}

export function Repositories() {
  const { repositories } = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Repositories</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading</div>}>
        <For each={repositories()}>
          {(repository) => <div key={repository.id}>{repository.name}</div>}
        </For>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export function Organizations() {
  const { organizations } = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organizations</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading</div>}>
        <For each={organizations()}>
          {(org) => <div key={org.id}>{org.name}</div>}
        </For>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function UserPage() {
  const { repositories, organizations } = useRouteData();
  return (
    <main>
      <Repositories />
      <Organizations />
    </main>
  );
}
```

<Aside type="advanced" title="What's the compiler doing?" collapsible>

The compiler is responsible for ensuring that the fetcher is only ever run on the server. It is also responsible for ensuring that the fetcher and any code/dependencies it uses is never shipped to the client. What the compiler essentially does is create an RPC mechanism between the server and client that is keyed by the file that the server function is defined in.

On the server, we hoist the fetcher function to the top of the module. This means that the fetcher function is always available to the server but can also only use dependecies or things declared in the module scope, but not in local parent scope. Anything else they need should be passed via the `source` parameter since they will need to be serialized when the user navigates to this page from another page.

```tsx
import { useRouteData, createRouteData } from "solid-start";
import server from "solid-start/server";
import db from "~/db";

const serverFunction0 = server.registerHandler(
  "/routes/user/[id]",
  0,
  async (userId) => {
    return await db.getRespositories(userId);
  }
);

const serverFunction1 = server.registerHandler(
  "/routes/user/[id]",
  1,
  async (userId) => {
    return await db.getOrganizations(userId);
  }
);

export function routeData({ params }) {
  return {
    repositories: createRouteData(() => params.userId, serverFunction0),
    organizations: createRouteData(() => params.userId, serverFunction1),
  };
}

// ... rest of the code
```

```tsx
import { useRouteData, createRouteData } from "solid-start";
import server from "solid-start/server";

const serverFunction0 = server.createFetcher("/routes/user/[id]", 0);
const serverFunction1 = server.createFetcher("/routes/user/[id]", 1);

export function routeData({ params }) {
  return {
    repositories: createRouteData(() => params.userId, serverFunction0),
    organizations: createRouteData(() => params.userId, serverFunction1),
  };
}

// ... rest of the code
```

</Aside>

The `routeData` function itself is a synchoronous function that takes arguments representing the current matched route. It's job is to initialize the fetch for async resources and return signals representing that data.

Most other frameworks give you one entrypoint to fetch data for a route, so regardless of any change in the url, we have to fetch all the data for that route even if some things have not changed.

With Solid, we are in fine-grained land, and we bring that philosophy here as well. You can create multiple independent resources that are refetched only when their specific sources change. You can then suspend on them individually and add different error boundaries for them because you can access those signals in different components. When a param changes that is not relevant to the data, we don't refetch that resource.

`Suspense` is an important part of the picture and is necessary for resources (and `createServerData`) to work properly. On the server, we only wait for resources that are declared and **accessed** inside a Suspense boundary. If you access the resources within a `Suspense` boundary, we make sure we wait for the resource to finish and render the page with the fulfilled data.

If the resource is not accessed, even though we start the fetcher, we send the html without waiting for the data. The client then again makes a request for the data since the server never serialized it.

This is why we have a top-level Suspense boundary in all our examples. You can add your own Suspense boundaries to make your loading states better.

The router will call this function as soon as you navigate to this route, even before the component code has loaded and started rendering. This avoids any waterfalls that lead to choppy UI.

<Aside type="warning">

You should not make the `routeData` function `async` itself.

```tsx bad
export async function routeData() {
  return await fetch("/pokemon/data");
}
```

</Aside>

## Route Params

When you name a file with a dynamic segment like `routes/users/[userId].tsx` and `routes/users/[userId]/projects/[projectId].tsx` the dynamic segments (the ones surrounded by `[...]`) will be parsed from the URL and passed to your `routeData` function on a reactive `params` object. They can be used as sources for your async resources. This ensures that when we navigate between variants of the same route with different parameters, we reload the data.

```tsx filename="routes/users/$userId/projects/$projectId.tsx"
export const routeData = async ({ params }: RouteDataArgs) => {
  console.log(params.userId);
  console.log(params.projectId);
};
```

These params are most useful for looking up data:

```tsx filename="routes/users/$userId/projects/$projectId.tsx" {8,9}
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params }) => {
  return json(
    await fakeDb.project.findMany({
      where: {
        userId: params.userId,
        projectId: params.projectId,
      },
    })
  );
};
```

The component renders on the server and in the browser. The loader _only runs on the server_. That means our hard-coded products array doesn't get included in the browser bundles and it's safe to use server-only for APIs and SDKs for things like database, payment processing, content management systems, etc.

If your server side modules end up in client bundles, move the imports for those modules to a file named `{something}.server.ts` with the `.server.ts` suffix to ensure they are excluded.

### Param Type Safety

Because these params come from the URL and not your source code, you can't know for sure if they will be defined. That's why the types on the param's keys are `string | undefined`. It's good practice to validate before using them, especially in TypeScript to get type safety. Using `invariant` makes it easy.

```tsx filename=routes/users/$userId/projects/$projectId.tsx lines=[1,7-8]
import invariant from "tiny-invariant";
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params }) => {
  invariant(params.userId, "Expected params.userId");
  invariant(params.projectId, "Expected params.projectId");

  params.projectId; // <-- TypeScript now knows this is a string
};
```

While you may be uncomfortable throwing errors like this with `invariant` when it fails, remember that in SolidStart you know the user will end up in the [error boundary][error-boundary] where they can recover from the problem instead of a broken UI.

## External APIs

SolidStart polyfills the `fetch` API on your server so it's very easy to fetch data from existing JSON APIs. Instead of managing state, errors, race conditions, and more yourself, you can do the fetch from your loader (on the server) and let SolidStart handle the rest.

```tsx filename=app/routes/gists.jsx lines=[5]
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

export async function loader() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.github.com/gists");
  return json(await res.json());
}

export default function GistsRoute() {
  const gists = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <ul>
      {gists.map((gist) => (
        <li key={gist.id}>
          <a href={gist.html_url}>{gist.id}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

This is great when you already have an API to work with and don't care or need to connect directly to your data source in your SolidStart app.

## Databases

Since SolidStart runs on your server, you can connect directly to a database in your route modules. For example, you could connect to a Postgres database with [Prisma][prisma].

```tsx filename=app/db.server.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
const db = new PrismaClient();
export { db };
```

And then your routes can import it and make queries against it:

```tsx filename=app/routes/products/$categoryId.tsx
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { db } from "~/db.server";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params }) => {
  return json(
    await db.product.findMany({
      where: {
        categoryId: params.categoryId,
      },
    })
  );
};

export default function ProductCategory() {
  const products = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{products.length} Products</p>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you are using TypeScript, you can use type inference to use Prisma Client generated types on when calling `useLoaderData`. This allows better type safety and intellisense when writing your code that uses the loaded data.

```tsx filename=tsx filename=app/routes/products/$productId.tsx
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { db } from "~/db.server";

type LoaderData = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof getLoaderData>>;

async function getLoaderData(productId: string) {
  const product = await db.product.findUnique({
    where: {
      id: productId,
    },
    select: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
      imgSrc: true,
    },
  });

  return product;
}

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params }) => {
  return json<LoaderData>(await getLoaderData(params.productId));
};

export default function Product() {
  const product = useLoaderData<LoaderData>();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Product {product.id}</p>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Not Found

While loading data it's common for a record to be "not found". As soon as you know you can't render the component as expected, `throw` a response and SolidStart will stop executing code in the current loader and switch over to the nearest [catch boundary][catch-boundary].

```tsx lines=[10-13]
export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params, request }) => {
  const product = await db.product.findOne({
    where: { id: params.productId },
  });

  if (!product) {
    // we know we can't render the component
    // so throw immediately to stop executing code
    // and show the not found page
    throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }

  const cart = await getCart(request);
  return json({
    product,
    inCart: cart.includes(product.id),
  });
};
```

## URL Search Params

URL Search Params are the portion of the URL after a `?`. Other names for this are "query string", "search string", or "location search". You can access the values by creating a URL out of the `request.url`:

```tsx filename=routes/products.tsx lines=[7,8]
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const term = url.searchParams.get("term");
  return json(await fakeProductSearch(term));
};
```

There are a few web platform types at play here:

- The [`request`][request] object has a `url` property
- [URL constructor][url] that parses the URL string into an object
- `url.searchParams` is an instance of [URLSearchParams][url-search-params], which is a parsed version of the location search string that makes it easy to read and manipulate the search string

Given the following URLs, the search params would be parsed as follows:

| URL                             | `url.searchParams.get("term")` |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/products?term=stretchy+pants` | `"stretchy pants"`             |
| `/products?term=`               | `""`                           |
| `/products`                     | `null`                         |

### Data Reloads

When multiple nested routes are rendering and the search params change, all of the routes will be reloaded (instead of just the new or changed routes). This is because search params are a cross-cutting concern and could effect any loader. If you would like to prevent some of your routes from reloading in this scenario, use [shouldReload][should-reload].

### Search Params in Components

Sometimes you need to read and change the search params from your component instead of your loaders and actions. There are handful of ways to do this depending on your use case.

**Setting Search Params**

Perhaps the most common way to set search params is letting the user control them with a form:

```tsx filename=app/routes/products/shoes.tsx lines=[8,9,16,17]
export default function ProductFilters() {
  return (
    <Form method="get">
      <label htmlFor="nike">Nike</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="nike" name="brand" value="nike" />

      <label htmlFor="adidas">Adidas</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="adidas" name="brand" value="adidas" />

      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

If the user only has one selected:

- [x] Nike
- [ ] Adidas

Then the URL will be `/products/shoes?brand=nike`

If the user has both selected:

- [x] Nike
- [x] Adidas

Then the url will be: `/products/shoes?brand=nike&brand=adidas`

Note that `brand` is repeated in the URL search string since both checkboxes were named `"brand"`. In your loader you can get access to all of those values with [`searchParams.getAll`][search-params-getall]

```tsx lines=[5]
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno

export async function loader({ request }) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const brands = url.searchParams.getAll("brand");
  return json(await getProducts({ brands }));
}
```

**Linking to Search Params**

As the developer, you can control the search params by linking to URLs with search strings in them. The link will replace the current search string in the URL (if there is one) with what is in the link:

```tsx
<Link to="?brand=nike">Nike (only)</Link>
```

**Reading Search Params in Components**

In addition to reading search params in loaders, you often need access to them in components, too:

```tsx lines=[1,4-5,15,24]
import { useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const brands = searchParams.getAll("brand");

  return (
    <Form method="get">
      <label htmlFor="nike">Nike</label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id="nike"
        name="brand"
        value="nike"
        defaultChecked={brands.includes("nike")}
      />

      <label htmlFor="adidas">Adidas</label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id="adidas"
        name="brand"
        value="adidas"
        defaultChecked={brands.includes("adidas")}
      />

      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

You might want to auto submit the form on any field change, for that there is [`useSubmit`][use-submit]:

```tsx lines=[2,7,14]
import { useSubmit, useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const submit = useSubmit();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const brands = searchParams.getAll("brand");

  return (
    <Form method="get" onChange={(e) => submit(e.currentTarget)}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

**Setting Search Params Imperatively**

While uncommon, you can also set searchParams imperatively at any time for any reason. The use cases here are slim, so slim we couldn't even come up with a good one, but here's a silly example:

```tsx
import { useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setSearchParams({ now: Date.now() });
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [setSearchParams]);

  // ...
}
```

### Search Params and Controlled Inputs

Often you want to keep some inputs, like checkboxes, in sync with the search params in the URL. This can get a little tricky with React's controlled component concept.

This is only needed if the search params can be set in two ways and we want the inputs to stay in sync with the search params. For example, both the `<input type="checkbox">` and the `Link` can change the brand in this component:

```tsx bad lines=[11-18]
import { useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const brands = searchParams.getAll("brand");

  return (
    <Form method="get">
      <p>
        <label htmlFor="nike">Nike</label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="nike"
          name="brand"
          value="nike"
          defaultChecked={brands.includes("nike")}
        />
        <Link to="?brand=nike">(only)</Link>
      </p>

      <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

If the user clicks the checkbox and submits the form, the URL updates and the checkbox state changes too. But if the user clicks the link _only the url will update and not the checkbox_. That's not what we want. You may be familiar with React's controlled components here and think to switch it to `checked` instead of `defaultChecked`:

```tsx bad lines=[6]
<input
  type="checkbox"
  id="adidas"
  name="brand"
  value="adidas"
  checked={brands.includes("adidas")}
/>
```

Now we have the opposite problem: clicking the link updates both the URL and the checkbox state but _the checkbox no longer works_ because React prevents the state from changing until the URL that controls it changes--and it never will because we can't change the checkbox and resubmit the form.

React wants you to control it with some state but we want the user to control it until they submit the form, and then we want the URL to control it when it changes. So we're in this "sorta-controlled" spot.

You have two choices, and what you pick depends on the user experience you want.

**First Choice**: The simplest thing is to auto-submit the form when the user clicks the checkbox:

```tsx lines=[2,7,20]
import { useSubmit, useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const submit = useSubmit();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const brands = searchParams.getAll("brand");

  return (
    <Form method="get">
      <p>
        <label htmlFor="nike">Nike</label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="nike"
          name="brand"
          value="nike"
          onChange={(e) => submit(e.currentTarget.form)}
          checked={brands.includes("nike")}
        />
        <Link to="?brand=nike">(only)</Link>
      </p>

      {/* ... */}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

(If you are also auto submitting on the form `onChange`, make sure to `e.stopPropagation()` so the event doesn't bubble up to the form, otherwise you'll get double submissions on every click of the checkbox.)

**Second Choice**: If you want the input to be "semi controlled", where the checkbox reflects the URL state, but the user can also toggle it on and off before submitting the form and changing the URL, you'll need to wire up some state. It's a bit of work but straightforward:

- Initialize some state from the search params
- Update the state when the user clicks the checkbox so the box changes to "checked"
- Update the state when the search params change (the user submitted the form or clicked the link) to reflect what's in the url search params

```tsx lines=[11-14,16-20,31-35]
import { useSubmit, useSearchParams } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function ProductFilters() {
  const submit = useSubmit();
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const brands = searchParams.getAll("brand");

  const [nikeChecked, setNikeChecked] = React.useState(
    // initialize from the URL
    brands.includes("nike")
  );

  // Update the state when the params change
  // (form submission or link click)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setNikeChecked(brands.includes("nike"));
  }, [brands, searchParams]);

  return (
    <Form method="get">
      <p>
        <label htmlFor="nike">Nike</label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="nike"
          name="brand"
          value="nike"
          onChange={(e) => {
            // update checkbox state w/o submitting the form
            setNikeChecked(true);
          }}
          checked={nikeChecked}
        />
        <Link to="?brand=nike">(only)</Link>
      </p>

      {/* ... */}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

You might want to make an abstraction for checkboxes like this:

```tsx
<div>
  <SearchCheckbox name="brand" value="nike" />
  <SearchCheckbox name="brand" value="reebok" />
  <SearchCheckbox name="brand" value="adidas" />
</div>;

function SearchCheckbox({ name, value }) {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const all = searchParams.getAll(name);
  const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(all.includes(value));

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setChecked(all.includes(value));
  }, [all, searchParams, value]);

  return (
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      name={name}
      value={value}
      checked={checked}
      onChange={(e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)}
    />
  );
}
```

**Option 3**: We said there were only two options, but there is a third unholy option that might tempt you if you know React pretty well. You might want to blow away the input and remount it with `key` prop shenanigans. While clever, this will cause accessibility issues as the user will lose focus when React removes the node from the document after they click it.

<docs-error>Don't do this, it will cause accessibility issues</docs-error>

```tsx bad lines=[6,7]
<input
  type="checkbox"
  id="adidas"
  name="brand"
  value="adidas"
  key={"adidas" + brands.includes("adidas")}
  defaultChecked={brands.includes("adidas")}
/>
```

## SolidStart Optimizations

SolidStart optimizes the user experiences by only loading the data for the parts of the page that are changing on navigation. For example, consider the UI you're using right now in these docs. The navbar on the side is in a parent route that fetched the dynamically generated menu of all the docs, and the child route fetched the document you're reading right now. If you click a link in the sidebar SolidStart knows that the parent route will remain on the page but the child route's data will change because the url param for the document will change. With this insight, SolidStart _will not refetch the parent route's data_.

Without SolidStart the next question is "how do I reload all of the data?". This is built into SolidStart as well. Whenever an [action][action] is called (the user submitted a form or you, the programmer, called `submit` from `useSubmit`), SolidStart will automatically reload all of the routes on the page to capture any changes that might have happened.

You don't have to worry about expiring caches or avoid overfetching data as the user interacts with your app, it's all automatic.

There are three cases where SolidStart will reload all of your routes:

- After an action (forms, `useSubmit`, [`fetcher.submit`][fetcher-submit])
- If the url search params change (any loader could use them)
- The user clicks a link to the exact same URL they are already at (this will also replace the current entry in the history stack)

All of these behaviors emulate the browser's default behavior. In these cases, SolidStart doesn't know enough about your code to optimize the data loading, but you can optimize it yourself with [unstable_shouldReload][should-reload].

## Data Libraries

Thanks to SolidStart's data conventions and nested routes, you'll usually find you don't need to reach for client side data libraries like React Query, SWR, Apollo, Relay, urql and others. If you're using global state management libraries like redux, primarily for interacting with data on the server, it's also unlikely you'll need those.

Of course, SolidStart doesn't prevent you from using them (unless they require bundler integration). You can bring whatever React data libraries you like and use them wherever you think they'll serve your UI better than the SolidStart APIs. In some cases you can use SolidStart for the initial server render and then switch over to your favorite library for the interactions afterward.

That said, if you bring an external data library and sidestep SolidStart's own data conventions, SolidStart can no longer automatically

- Server render your pages
- Be resilient to network conditions when JavaScript fails to load
- Make optimizations as the user interacts with your site to make it fast by only loading data for the changing parts of the page
- Fetch data, JavaScript modules, CSS and other assets in parallel on transitions, avoiding render+fetch waterfalls that lead to choppy UI
- Ensure the data in the UI is in sync with the data on the server by revalidating after actions
- Excellent scroll restoration on back/forward clicks (even across domains)
- Handle server side errors with [error boundaries][error-boundary]
- Enable solid UX for "Not Found" and "Unauthorized" with [catch boundaries][catch-boundary]
- Help you keep the happy path of your UI happy.

Instead you'll need to do extra work to provide a good user experience.

SolidStart is designed to meet any user experience you can design. While it's unexpected that you _need_ an external data library, you might still _want_ one and that's fine!

As you learn SolidStart, you'll find you shift from thinking in client state to thinking in URLs, and you'll get a bunch of stuff for free when you do.

## Gotchas

1. `SSR`:
   The fetchers for resouces in `routeData` are called on the server or from the client based on how the user arrives at the page. When its runs on the server, your data is serialized with `JSON.stringify` and sent over the network before it makes it to your component for hydration. This means your data needs to be serializable. For example:

<docs-error>This won't work!</docs-error>

```tsx bad nocopy {3-6}
export async function loader() {
  return {
    date: new Date(),
    someMethod() {
      return "hello!";
    },
  };
}

export default function RouteComp() {
  const data = useLoaderData();
  console.log(data);
  // '{"date":"2021-11-27T23:54:26.384Z"}'
}
```

Not everything makes it! Resources are for _data_, and data needs to be serializable.

Some databases (like [FaunaDB][fauna]) return objects with methods that you'll want to be careful to serialize before returning from your loader. Usually this isn't a problem, but it's good to understand that your data is traveling over the network.

Additionally, SolidStart will call your `routeData` functions for you, in no case should you ever try to call your `routeData` function directly:

<docs-error>This is not recommended</docs-error>

```tsx bad nocopy
export const routeData = async () => {
  return createResource(async () => ({ message: "Hello World" }));
};

export default function RouteComp() {
  const data = routeData();
  // ...
}
```
