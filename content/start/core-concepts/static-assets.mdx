# Static Assets

Rich web applications use static assets to store data and images that are not changing. In SolidStart, you can use the `/public` directory to store static assets. They will be served at the exact path they are in relative to the public directory. For example,

```
|-- public
|   favicon.ico
|   |-- images

- Images, favicon, service worker
- Assets describe how can include files in `/public` or import files as path
  - Look into difference and prescribe when to do each
```
