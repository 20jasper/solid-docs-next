# Static Assets

Rich web applications use assets to create visua. In SolidStart, you can use the `/public` directory to store static assets. They will be served at the exact path they are in relative to the public directory. For example,

```
|-- public
|   favicon.ico                   ->  /favicon.ico
|   |-- images
|   |   |-- logo.png              ->  /images/logo.png
|   |   |-- background.png        ->  /images/background.png
|   |-- models
|   |   |-- player.gltf           ->  /models/player.gltf
|   |-- documents
|   |   |-- report.pdf            ->  /documents/report.pdf
```

- Images, favicon, service worker
