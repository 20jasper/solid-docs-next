# The New Solid Docs

## Welcome

Welcome to Solid's new docs site! These pages are the beginnings of our new effort, and we're super excited for you to join us.

Solid is a front-end framework for building web apps. It's designed to have a great developer experience, and we want the docs to match, both in terms of being beginner-friendly and showcasing the usability of the framework.

[Learn about Solid in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3Bx5vxKl0), or watch a [more detailed intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70HXl1KhWE).

## Thanks to our docs contributors
