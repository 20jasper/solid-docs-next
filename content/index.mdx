# SolidJS Documentation

## Overview

Solid is a modern JavaScript framework designed to build responsive and high-performing user interfaces (UI).
It prioritizes a streamlined and predictable development experience, making it an excellent choice for developers of varying skill levels.

## What is Solid?

As a JavaScript framework, Solid embraces reactivity and fine-grained updates.

In programming, reactivity refers to the ability of an application to respond to changes in data or user interactions.
Traditionally, when a change occurs, the entire web page would need to reload to display the updated information.

In contrast, a reactive system, such as Solid, updates only the necessary parts of the page, providing a more efficient and dynamic user experience.

Solid's fine-grained reactivity selectively update only the components dependent on the changed state.
This avoids unnecessary updates and ensures optimal performance.

## Advantages of using Solid

- **Performant**: Due to its fine-grained reactivity, Solid only updates the parts of the application that need to be changed when data is modified.
  This minimizes unnecessary work and can result in faster load times and smoother performance overall.

- **Powerful**: Despite using less memory and processing power, Solid does not compromise on functionality.
  Thanks to its powerful API, it is capable of creating complex applications and gives developers flexibility over how and when updates happen.

- **Pragmatic**: Solid's pragmatism provides practical, effective solutions.
  Rather than sticking to rigid structures or methods, Solid gives developers the freedom to choose the strategies and practices that work best.
  With the option to integrate with other technologies, it's possible to add Solid to existing projects or build entirely new ones.

- **Productive**: With a clear and predictable API, Solid makes developers' work productive and simpler.
  It is accessible regardless of experience level thanks to easier debugging and less boilerplate code.

In essence, Solid aims to strike a balance between speed, efficiency, power, and flexibility, all while providing a developer-friendly environment.
This combination of features makes it a great choice for building responsive and high-performing UIs.
