## Sass

Sass is a third-party package that makes styling easier by making CSS programmable using @functions, @mixins, and more. Learning Sass is beyond the scope of this guide, but we will demonstrate how to get started using Sass in Solid.

Steps:

```
npm i --save-dev sass
pnpm i --dev sass
```

Then, we can refactor our previous code to as follows:

```
// styles.scss
.foo {
  color: red;
}

.bar {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

```
// component.jsx
import "./styles.scss"

function Component() {
  return (<>
    <div class="foo bar">
      Hello, world!
    </>
  </>)
}
```

By changing our file extension from `.css` to `.scss`, Vite (the build tool Solid uses) automatically recognized we are importing a Sass file and compiled Sass to CSS on demand.
