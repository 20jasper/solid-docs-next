# Less 
LESS stands for Leaner CSS. LESS is a CSS preprocessor based on Javascript, LESS gives you the ability to make use of mixins and other programmatical tools. It helps in making your styling code cleaner and less redundant. 

Let's take a look at how you can make use of LESS in your Solid apps

Steps:
```
npm install --save-dev less
pnpm i --dev less
yarn add less
```

Let's refactor our previous code as follows

```less
//styles.less

.foo {
  color: red;
}

.bar {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Take note of how the basic syntax is very similar to that of CSS. If you would like to declare variables in LESS you can do so as you usually would, for example 

```less
//styles.less
@plainred: red;
@plainblue: blue

.foo {
  color: @plainred;
}

.bar {
  background-color: @plainblue;
}
```

Write your LESS styles like you would anywhere else. Let's change the file extension of the `styles.css` import to `.less`.

```jsx
//component.jsx

import "./styles.less";

function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <div class="foo bar">Hello, world!</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

By changing our file extension from `.css` to `.less`, Vite (the build tool Solid uses) automatically recognized we are importing a LESS file and compiled LESS to CSS on demand.
