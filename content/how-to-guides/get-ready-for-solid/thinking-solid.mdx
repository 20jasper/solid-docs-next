<Title> Thinking Solid </Title>

Solid's design carries several opinions on what principles and values help us best build websites and applications. It is easier to learn and use Solid when you are aware of the philosophy behind it.

And in this section we will be discussing about those specific principles. We will be discussing these principles at a high level in order for it to be understood by everyone.

### 1. Declarative Data

Declarative data or declarative programming is the process of programming in a way that describes what your program does and not how it does it. The opposite of this is imperative programming. Let's look at a quick example of these.

#### Declarative

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let double = numbers.map((value, i) => value * 2);
```

In the piece of code above `double` is simply a copy of the values in the `numbers` array, except those values were doubled before assigning them to `double`

#### Imperative

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let double = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  double.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}
```

The piece of code above does the same thing as the declaritve code, however, as you can see it is more complex and seems more tedious than the declaritive approach.

Solid makes use of the declarative approach to programming in a lot of aspects in order to make it simpler and quicker to adopt and understand.

### 2. Vanishing Components

It's hard enough to structure your components without taking updates into consideration. Solid updates are completely independent of the components. Component functions are called once and then cease to exist. Components exist to organize your code and not much else. Here's a quick diagram or what that process looks like
