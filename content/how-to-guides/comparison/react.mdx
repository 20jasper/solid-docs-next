<Title>Comparison with React</Title>

React has had a big influence on Solid. Its unidirectional flow and explicit segregation of read and write in its
Hooks API informed Solid's API. More so than the objective of being just a "Render Library" rather than a framework.
Solid has strong opinions on how to approach managing data in application development but doesn't seek to constrain
its execution.

However, as much as Solid aligns with React's design philosophy, it works fundamentally differently. This API similarity
with a different execution model usually throws off React developers that expect certain React patterns to be transferable
to Solid. This guide is here to help point out those differences and how to overcome them.

## Components as render functions vs setup functions

In a simplified explanation, React components work as a way to organize your code and handle view updates derive from state
or props changes. This means that every time there's an update, React wil re-run the component with the latest state/props
to reflect it in the view. Let's take a look at the following example

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count is: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prevCoutn) => prevCount + 1)}>
        Increase count by 1
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

Whenever we click our button, we will trigger a state update resulting in a re-run of our component

<IfDark
  fallback={
    <img
      src="/images/how-to-guides/comparison/react/react-simple-state-update-light.png"
      alt="A screenshot of the file browser in Stackblitz, displaying all of the files in the template"
    />
  }

  />
</IfDark>

### Conditional render and the use of `<Show />`
