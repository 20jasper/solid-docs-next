# Stores
Solid's stores are dynamic containers that play an important role in state management.
By centralizing data in a store, it provides a way to synchronize and share state across different components, keeping a cohesive data flow in applications.

signal is one value
store is collection

## Understanding stores

### What is a store?

A store, in Solid's context, is a reactive container tailored for state management.
It allows the storage and updating of a range of data structures, from simple values to complex objects and arrays. 

One of the features of stores is the use of JavaScript's [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) mechanism, which allows them to encapsulate other objects and produce a reactive tree of data.
This means that, when working with stores, they can be navigated through a network of reactive signals, each representing a property.

Stores do two primary things:
1. **Reactivity**: By making each property its own signal, Solid can track and react to specific property changes without unnecessary re-renders.
This is done since signals are created lazily, meaning only when properties have been accessed within tracking scopes are they created. 
2. **Nested data structures**: The proxy-based system ensures even nested data structures, like objects within objects, remain reactive.

### Components of a store

A store can be broken down into two core components:
* **State**: This component holds the actual data within the store. 
It can encompass various data types, from basic values like numbers and strings to more complex structures such as arrays or objects.
* **Setters**: Setters are functions specifically designed for updating the state in a controlled manner. 
By using setters, any changes to a store's state will be deliberate *and* reactive.

## Using stores

### Creating a store

Solid's `createStore` function provides the entry point to set up a store. 
Housed within the `solid-js/store` package, it takes an initial state as its argument and returns de-structured array with a read-only state proxy and a setter function:

```jsx
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store";

// Initialize store
const [state, setState] = createStore({ todos: [], numberOfTasks: 0 });
```

### Accessing values

Store properties can be accessed directly from the reactive state by using the state proxy to directly reference any property:

```jsx
console.log(state.tasks) // Outputs: 0
```

### Modifying store values

In Solid, updating values within a store is best accomplished using a setter provided by the `createStore` initialization.
This setter allows for the modification of a specific key and its associated value, following the format `setStore(key, newValue)`:

```jsx
setState("tasks", [
    { id: 1, task: "Learn Solid", completed: false },
    { id: 2, task: "Tune into Ryan Carniato's live stream", completed: false },
    "numberOfTasks", 2
])

// JS EXAMPLES

{
    todos: [
        { id: 1, task: "Learn Solid", completed: false },
        { id: 2, task: "Tune into Ryan Carniato's live stream", completed: false },
    ],
     "numberOfTasks", 2
}
```

<Aside>
    Separating read and write capabilities to a store presents a valuable debugging advantage.
    It facilitates the tracking and control of which components can access or change store values.
