## Class & style

Similar to HTML, Solid uses class  and style attributes to style elements via [CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS).

* **Class Attribute**: Important when styling one or more elements.
* **Style Attribute**: Inline styles that serve the purpose of styling a single element.

### Inline styling

The `style` attribute lets you style a single element and define CSS variables dynamically during runtime. 
Solid acknowledges `style` in both string (e.g. `<div style="color: red;"` /> and object forms  (e.g. `<div style={{ "color": "red" }}>` ).

If you are styling using the object form, the keys will require dash-case form and any units must be explicitly provided:

```html
<div style={{
  color: `red`,
* font-weight": 800,
* font-size": '2rem'
}}
>
  Some Text
</div>
```

Inline styles come in handy for rapid prototyping, setting dynamic CSS variables, and overriding classes. 
However, because Solid uses JSX, it is not recommended to use the `style` tag within the JSX code directly. 
Doing this clutters the component logic, making the code less readable and harder to maintain over time.

### Classes

Through the `class` attribute, you can style elements using CSS. 
Solid's support for `classList` lets you switch classes based on dynamic values. 
The `class` attribute recommended for its self-documentation and it also offers performance advantages. 

For a structured approach, pair CSS files with their respective component files. 
Importing these files will globally scope them, meaning elements using those classes will inherit those styles automatically. 

```jsx
import "./Card.css";
function Card() {
  // ...
}
```
