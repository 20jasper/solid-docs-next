# Understanding JSX

[ï»¿JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript. 
It allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript file which keeps your rendering logic and content in the same place. 
This provides a concise and readable way to create and represent components.

## How Solid uses JSX
Solid is designed to align closely with HTML standards, which offers a distinct advantage: developers can integrate solutions from resources like Stack Overflow or directly use templates from design tools.

What sets Solid's components apart is their ability to return JSX, which can then be imported into other components. 
This creates reusability across your application as well as modularity and maintainability.

Furthermore, Solid's reactive system introduces fine-grained [reactivity](/essentials/intro-to-reactivity) with JSX. 
This means only the necessary parts of the DOM get updated when there's a change in the underlying state, promoting efficiency and performance.

## JSX compared to HTML
 At first glance, JSX might seem almost identical to HTML, but there are some differences and similarities that are crucial to note. 

#### JavaScript expressions
In JSX, embedding JavaScript directly into your markup is not only possible; it's a common practice. 
This is achieved using `{ }`.

```jsx
const animal = { breed: "cat", name: "Midnight" };
const element = <p>I have a {animal.breed} named {animal.name}!</p>;
```

This allows for dynamic content to be injected directly into the rendered output based on the application's state or logic.

#### Elements

Unline HTML, where you can have several disconnected tags at the top level, JSX requires that a component's render method returns a single root element.

Note: If you are looking to return multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM, you would need to use a fragment (`<> ... </>`).

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Some text.</p>
</>
```
</Aside>

With element structure, JSX maintains the nested, tree-like structure you're accustomed to in HTML. This means, like in HTML, parent-child relationships between elements are clear and intuitive.

#### Properties vs. attributes

While they seem similar, there's a difference between HTML attributes and JSX properties (often referred to as props).

Attributes in HTML are the values you set directly on the HTML elements. 
They provide additional information about the element and set its initial properties. 
Once the browser parses your HTML, these attributes are often reflected as properties on DOM objects.

Props, on the other hand, are a mechanism in JSX for passing data and configurations to components. 
Props allow for dynamic data transfer and functionality assignments in your Solid application.

See Solid's [Components & Props](//essentials/components-and-props) page for more about how to use props in Solid.

#### Self-closing tags
Self-closing tags are a must in JSX. 
In HTML, some elements like `<input>`, `<img>`, or `<br>` don't need to be closed explicitly. 
However, in JSX, every element needs to be closed, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential rendering issues.
