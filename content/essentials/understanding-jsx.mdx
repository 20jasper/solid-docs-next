# Understanding JSX

[ï»¿JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript. 
It allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript file which keeps your rendering logic and content in the same place. 
This provides a concise and readable way to create and represent components.

## How Solid uses JSX
Solid was designed to align closely with HTML standards. 
It offers a distinct advantage: copy/paste solutions from resources like Stack Overflow, and direct usage of templates from design tools.

What sets Solid's apart is the ability to return JSX. 
This JSX can then be imported into other components, promoting reusability, modularity, and ease of maintenance throughout your application.

Additionally, Solid's [reactive](/essentials/intro-to-reactivity) system introduces [fine-grained reactivity](/advanced/understanding-fine-grained-reactivity) with JSX.
This ensures that only the necessary portions of the DOM are updated when changes occur in the underlying state, optimizing efficiency and overall performance.

### Integrating JavaScript expressions
In JSX, you can dynamically embed JavaScript directly into your markup using curly braces `{ }`.

```jsx
const animal = { breed: "cat", name: "Midnight" };
const element = <p>I have a {animal.breed} named {animal.name}!</p>;
```

This allows for the injection of dynamic content into the rendered output based on the application's state or logic.

### Structuring elements

Unlike HTML, where you can have disconnected tags at the top level, JSX requires that a component's render method returns a single root element.

Note: If you are looking to return multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM, you would need to use a fragment (`<> ... </>`).

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Some text.</p>
</>
```
</Aside>

With its structured approach, JSX maintains the familiar nested, tree-like structure found in HTML. 
Consequently, parent-child relationships between elements are intuitive and easy to understand.

### Properties vs. attributes

Although similar, there's a distinction between HTML attributes and JSX properties, often referred to as props.

HTML attributes are values set directly on HTML elements. 
They provide supplementary information about the element and initialize its properties. 
These attributes are often translated into properties on DOM objects once the browser parses the HTML.

In contrast, JSX props are a mechanism for passing data and configurations to components. 
Props facilitate dynamic data transfer and assignment of functionalities within your Solid application.

### Self-closing tags
Self-closing tags are a must in JSX. 
Unlike in HTML, where elements like `<input>`, `<img>`, or `<br>` don't require explicit closure, JSX requires consistent self-closing tags. 
This ensures uniformity and helps avoid potential rendering issues.
