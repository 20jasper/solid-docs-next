# Class & Style Bindings

Similar to HTML, Solid uses `class` and `style` attributes to style elements via [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS).

* **Class Attribute**: Enables styling one or more elements through CSS rules.
* **Style Attribute**: Inline styles that style single elements.

## Inline styling

The `style` attribute lets you style a single element and define CSS variables dynamically during runtime. 
Solid allows `style` in both string (e.g. `<div style="color: red;"` /> and object forms  (e.g. `<div style={{ "color": "red" }}>` ).

If you are styling using the object form, the keys will require dash-case form and any units must be explicitly provided:

```jsx
<div style={{
  color: `red`,
 "font-weight": 800,
 "font-size": '2rem'
}}
>
  Some Text
</div>
```

Inline styles come in handy for rapid prototyping, setting dynamic CSS variables, and overriding classes. 
However, because Solid uses JSX, it is not recommended to use the `style` tag within the JSX code directly. 
Doing this clutters the component logic, making the code less readable and harder to maintain over time.

## Classes

Through the `class` attribute, you can style elements using CSS.
The `class` attribute offers self-documentation and performance advantages over `style`.

For a structured approach, pair CSS files with their respective component files. 
Importing these files will globally scopes them.
This means that the elements using those classes will inherit the styles automatically across the whole project, not just the ones located in the file they are imported into.

```jsx
import "./Card.css";
function Card() {
  // ...
}
```

### Dynamic styling

Dynamic styling allows interfaces to adapt and respond to various factors, such as user interaction or device preferences. 

Component states serve as a primary mechanism for managing dynamic data within a component.
This state can directly influence styles or, more flexibly, CSS variables.

Rather than changing a style directly, these variables can be changed based on a single state:

```tsx
const [theme, setTheme] = createSignal("light");

<div class={theme() === 'light' ? 'light-theme' : 'dark-theme'}>
  This div's theme is determined dynamically!
</div>
```

[Props](/concepts/components/props) are another way to change styles. 
By passing props to components, you can adapt styles based on the component's usage or the data it receives:

```tsx
function ThemedButton({ theme }) {
  return (
    <button class={theme}>
      {theme === 'light' ? 'Light Button' : 'Dark Button'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### `classList`

In scenarios where you may want to conditionally set classes, Solid offers the built-in [`classList` JSX attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList). 
This attribute takes an object where the key represents the class name(s) and the value is a boolean expression. 
When the value is `true`, the class is applied; when `false`, it is removed.

When handling multiple conditional classes, `classList` is often more efficient. 
This is because `classList` selectively toggles only the classes that require alteration, while `class` will be re-evaluated each time.
For a single conditional class, using `class` might be simpler. 
However, as the number of conditional classes increases, `classList` offers a more readable and declarative approach.

```tsx
  const [current, setCurrent] = createSignal("foo");

    <button
     classList={current() === 'foo' ? 'selected' : ''}
     onClick={() => setCurrent('foo')}
    >foo</button>
```

<Aside>
**Caution**: While it is possible, mixing `class` and `classList` can introduce unexpected errors.
If both are reactive, the following can occur: when the `class` value changes, Solid will set the entire `class` attribute, meaning any toggles in `classList` will be overwritten.
<br />
The main 'safe' situation is when `class` is set to a static string (or nothing) and `classList` is reactive.
Alternatively, `class` could be set to a static computed value (e.g. `class={baseClass()}`), but then it must be put before any `classList` attributes.
<br />
Since `classList` is a pseudo-attribute, it doesn't work in prop spreads like <div {...props} /> or in `<Dynamic>`.
