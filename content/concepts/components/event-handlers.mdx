# Event handlers

Events handlers play an important role in capturing user interactions and executing the relevant logic based on those interactions.

In Solid, event handlers are prefixed with `on`, to help distinguish them from other properties and attributes in your components.
They can be written as either `onClick` and `onclick`, catering to different coding styles or project conventions.

```tsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

<Aside>
  Events remain static and are _not_ reactive.
  This is to avoid the costly process of continuously attaching and detaching listeners.
  Given that event handlers are called like regular functions upon each event trigger, there's no inherent need for them to be reactive.
  <br />
  If necessary, you can write your handlers accordingly to call a reactive source:

    ```tsx
    <div onClick={() => props.handleClick?.()} />
    ```

## Event delegation

Rather than attaching event listeners to every individual element, Solid uses artificial event delegation. 
This technique consolidates some event listening at a higher level in the document, allowing events to be captured more effectively on one place instead of many. 
Supported events such as `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown` are just a few examples that are optimized in this way. To view the full list see the [references below](#delegated-events).

**Note**: If you need to support other casings or want to avoid the event delegation, you can use [on:](/reference/on-and-oncapture) to match event handlers that follows the colon.

## Binding events

Solid can bind data to event handlers without incurring the usual overhead of JavaScript's [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) method or additional closures. 
To achieve this you will have to pass an array to the event handler. Notably, the **second item** of the array will be supplied as the handler's **first argument**.

```jsx
const handler = (data, event) => {
   console.log('Data:', data, 'Event:', event);
}

<button onClick={[handler, 'Hello!']}>Click Me</button>
```

In this example, the string `'Hello!'` (the second item in the array) is passed as the data parameter (the first argument of the handler function) when the button is clicked.
