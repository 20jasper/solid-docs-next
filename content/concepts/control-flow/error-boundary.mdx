# Error Boundary

The `<ErrorBoundary>` component serves as a protective layer around child components that are susceptible to throwing errors.
By catching these errors, it prevents them from propagating and causing the entire application to crash:

```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "solid-js"

<ErrorBoundary fallback={(err) => <div>Error: {err.message}</div>}>
	<ProblematicComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

In this setup, the `fallback` prop is important.
It determines what will be rendered in place of the child component(s) if an error is thrown.
The `fallback` prop can take a function that receives the caught error as an argument, providing a flexible way to handle different error scenarios.

If a component within `<ErrorBoundary>` throws an error, instead of causing a crash, `<ErrorBoundary>` will catch the error and render the fallback UI.
This way, even when a component fails, the user has a controlled UI response instead of a broken interface.
The fallback UI can be used to display the error message, or provide a friendly notification to the user.
This mechanism aids in error containment and provides a better user experience even when unexpected issues arise in the UI.
