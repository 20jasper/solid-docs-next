# Portal

The `<Portal>` element assists in tackling the difficulties that are typically encountered with overlay elements like modals.
When an element requires rendering outside of the usual document flow, challenges related to stacking contents and z-index can present.
`<Portal>` enables the rendering elements of these elements so they are rendered correctly and interactively.

```jsx
import { Portal } from "solid-js"

<Portal>
	<div class="popup">...</div>
</Portal>
```

The content nested within `<Portal>` is positioned at a designated location when shown.
By default, Solid will render these elements in a `div` within `document.body` to make sure they are not bound by the styling or layout restrictions of the parent component.

Using `<Portal>` can be particularly useful in cases where elements, like information popups, might be clipped or obscured due to the overflow settings of their parent elements.
By encapsulating the element within `<Portal>`, it is effectively lifted from the standard flow and positioned in a manner that is both visually accessible and no longer effected by the layout constraints of its surrounding environment.
