# Dynamic

`<Dynamic>` introduces a dynamic component rendering capability, allowing you to select and render components based on varying data.
You can provide it with either a string representing a [native HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) or a component function.
Once you have chosen the component to render, `<Dynamic>` will show the remaining props you provide.
This flexibility makes it a versatile tool for UI that changes based on data or user interactions:

```jsx
import { createSignal, Switch, Match, For } from "solid-js"

const RedDiv = () => <div style="color: red">Red</div>
const GreenDiv = () => <div style="color: green">Green</div>
const BlueDiv = () => <div style="color: blue">Blue</div>

const options = {
	red: RedDiv,
	green: GreenDiv,
	blue: BlueDiv,
}

function App() {
	const [selected, setSelected] = createSignal("red")

	return (
		<>
			<select
				value={selected()}
				onInput={(e) => setSelected(e.currentTarget.value)}
			>
				<For each={Object.keys(options)}>
					{(color) => <option value={color}>{color}</option>}
				</For>
			</select>
			<Dynamic component={options[selected()]} />
		</>
	)
}
```

In this example, the `component` prop of `<Dynamic>` is assigned a value from the `options` object, which is indexed by the result of the `selected()` signal call.
This dynamic assignment results in rendering the chosen component or element with the provided properties.

Using `<Dynamic>` in scenarios like this can result in code that is more succinct and visually cleaner than alternative conditional rendering options.
If you were to replace it with a conditional rendering statement, the code would look something like this:

```jsx
<Switch fallback={<BlueDiv />}>
	<Match when={selected() === "red"}>
		<RedDiv />
	</Match>
	<Match when={selected() === "green"}>
		<GreenDiv />
	</Match>
</Switch>
```

In this [`<Switch>` statement](/concepts/control-flow/conditional-rendering), the `<Match>` components provide conditions to render specific components based on the result of `selected()`, which aligns with the behavior achieved using `<Dynamic>`.
However, `<Dynamic>` offers a more compact and readable way to achieve the same outcome.
