# Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in Solid introduces dedicated components that simplify the way UI is handled based on the desired conditions.
These components offer a more straightforward and readable way to manage UI elements and make code more organized and maintainable.

## Show

The `<Show>` component integrates JavaScript control logic flow within templates.
This offers a more readable way to handle [conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals).

`<Show>` uses a `when` property that determines the condition for rendering.
It accepts a boolean expression, which can be as simple as a boolean variable or complex expressions that evaluate to a boolean.
This expression is re-evaluated whenever there is a change in the state or props it depends on.

In addition to `when`, `<Show>` has an optional `fallback` property.
Any valid JSX content or components can act as a fallback, ranging from simple text or HTML elements, to more complex components.

```jsx
import { Show } from "solid-js"

<Show when={!data.loading} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
	<h1>Hi, I am {data().name}.</h1>
</Show>
```

With this example, when the `!data.loading` condition is truthy, the primary content between the `<Show>` tags is rendered.
If it is falsy, the fallback content is rendered, if provided.

When certain conditions are not met, `<Show>` can be used to show alternative content such as loaders, error messages, or other content that makes sense in the context of your application.

## Switch and Match

Handling multiple conditions in Solid can be managed through the `<Switch>` and `<Match>` components, which is similar to JavaScript's [switch/case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) structure.

Simlar to show, `<Switch>` has the optional `fallback` prop available, which will specify the content be rendered when none of the `<Match>` components evaluate to true.
`<Match>`, however, is nested within `<Switch>` to represent individual conditions.
These components will show based on when the `when` prop is evaluated to be true.

Each condition is evlauted _in sequence_ and will render the corresponding outcome based on the **first true condition** encountered:

```jsx
import { Switch, Match } from "solid-js"

<Switch fallback={<p>Fallback content</p>}>
	<Match when={condition1}>
		<p>Outcome 1</p>
	</Match>
	<Match when={condition2}>
		<p>Outcome 2</p>
	</Match>
</Switch>
```

Opting for this approach removes the need for nested `<Show>` components:

```jsx
// nested show
<Show
    when={x() > 10}
      fallback={
        <Show
          when={5 > x()}
          fallback={<p>{x()} is between 5 and 10</p>}
        >
          <p>{x()} is less than 5</p>
        </Show>
      }
    >
      <p>{x()} is greater than 10</p>
    </Show>

// switch/match alternative:

<Switch fallback={<p>{x()} is between 5 and 10</p>}>
  <Match when={x() > 10}>
    <p>{x()} is greater than 10</p>
  </Match>
  <Match when={5 > x()}>
    <p>{x()} is less than 5</p>
  </Match>
</Switch>
```
