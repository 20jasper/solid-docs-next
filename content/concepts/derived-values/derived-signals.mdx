## Derived signals

Derived signals are a more advanced use of the basic signal concept through letting you establish dependencies on one or more exsiting signals:

```js
const double = () => count() * 2;
```

A function that relies on a signal is essentially a signal itself: when the underlying signal that is accessed is changed, the function will update any components or functions that rely on it.
These dependent functions gain reactivity from the signal they access, ensuring that changes in the underlying data propagate throughout your application. 
It is important to note that these functions do not store a value themselves; instead, they can update any effects or components that depend on them. 
If included within a component's body, these derived signals will trigger an update when necessary.

While you can create derived values in this manner, Solid created the [`createMemo`](/reference/creatememo) primitive.
