# Understanding JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. 
It allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript file which keeps your rendering logic and content in the same place. 
This provides a concise and readable way to create and represent components.

## How Solid uses JSX

Solid was designed to align closely with HTML standards. 
It offers a distinct advantage, however: to copy/paste solutions from resources like Stack Overflow; and to allow direct usage of templates from design tools.

Solid sets itself apart by using JSX immediately as it returns [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) elements. 
This adds dynamic expressions that allow you to reference variables and functions within your HTML by using the `{ }` syntax:

```jsx
const animal = { breed: "cat", name: "Midnight" };
const element = <p>I have a {animal.breed} named {animal.name}!</p>;
```

This allows for the use of JavaScript content in the rendered output based on the application's state or logic.

Additionally, Solid's [reactive](/concepts/intro-to-reactivity) system introduces [fine-grained reactivity](/advanced/fine-grained-reactivity) with JSX.
This ensures that only the necessary portions of the DOM are updated when changes occur in the underlying state, optimizing efficiency and overall performance.

## Using JSX in Solid

### Return a single root element

Unlike HTML, where you can have disconnected tags at the top level, JSX requires that a component's render method returns a single root element.

When working with JSX, the system translates parts of your code into structured HTML that is placed at the start of the file.
Static elements, which do not change, are processed differently from dynamic ones, which might change based on data or user actions. 
For dynamic elements, special markers are added for better handling during rendering.

Having a single root ensures a consistent and manageable hierarchy, optimizing rendering and updates.

With its structured approach, JSX maintains the familiar nested, tree-like structure found in HTML. 
Consequently, parent-child relationships between elements are intuitive and easy to understand.

### Close all tags

Self-closing tags are a must in JSX. 
Unlike in HTML, where elements like `<input>`, `<img>`, or `<br>` don't require explicit closure, JSX requires consistent self-closing tags. 
This ensures uniformity and helps avoid potential rendering issues.

### Properties vs. attributes

At first glance, HTML attributes and JSX properties may seem similar, but they serve different purposes and behave differently.
Both offer ways to specify configurations or pass information, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in their respective realms â€” HTML for standard web content and JSX for Solid's component logic.

#### HTML attributes

[HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) are values set directly on HTML elements. 
They supply additional information about an element, guiding its initial behavior and state. 
These attributes are often translated into properties on DOM objects once the browser parses the HTML.

In JSX files, you'll use HTML attributes in much the same way you would in regular HTML, with a few key differences due to the blend of HTML and JavaScript:

* Event listeners such as `onClick` are in camelCase.
* In cases where you can dynamically specify a value, you can replace the `"` and `"` with `{` and `}`.

```jsx
<button class="myClass" onClick={handleClick}> Click me!</button>
```

<Aside>
  **Note**: If you wish to pass objects in JSX, such as when you are doing inline styling, you will have to use double curly braces `{{ }}`.

  ```jsx
  <button style={{
    color: 'red',
    font-size: '2rem',
  }}>
    Click me!
  </button>
  ```
</Aside>

### JSX properties (props)

JSX properties, commonly known as "props," enable the passing of data and configurations to components in your application.
They are the bridge between the component and the data it requires, providing seamless data flow and dynamic interaction.

#### Core concepts

* **Static vs. dynamic attributes**: 
In Solid's JSX, static attributes are integrated directly into the cloned HTML template. 
Dynamic attributes, however, are not hard-coded into the template, instead relying on the state and other reactive data sources. 
This allows for content or styling of an element to change in response to interactions or other changes in the application's data.

* **Dynamic data transfer**: 
Props play a pivotal role when using dynamic data within your application. 
They empower components to react in real-time to data changes, resulting in a responsive application.

<Aside>
  Expressions, whether fixed or dynamic, get applied in the order defined within the JSX. 
  This sequence works for a wide range of DOM elements.
  However, be cautious with elements like input types with `type='range'` - the order matters and it can influence the element's behavior.
