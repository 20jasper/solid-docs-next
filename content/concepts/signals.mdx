# Signals

Signals are the primary means of [managing state](/concepts/intro-to-reactivity#state-management) in your Solid application.
They create a reactive state variable to give you access to the current state value, and a way to update that value.

Signals can be used to represent any kind of state in your application, such as the current user, the current page, or the current theme.
This can be any value, including primitive values such as strings and numbers, or complex values such as objects and arrays.

## Creating a signal

You can create a signal by calling the [`createSignal`](/reference/createSignal) function, which is imported from `solid-js`:
This function takes an initial value as an argument, and returns a pair of functions: a **getter** function, and a **setter** function.

```jsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [ count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
//       ^ getter  ^ setter
```

<Aside>
  The syntax using `[` and `]` is called [array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). 
  This lets you extract values from the array. 
  In the context of `createSignal`, the first value is the getter function, and the second value is the setter function.
</Aside>

## Accessing values

To access the current value of a signal, you call the getter function returned by `createSignal`:

```jsx
console.log(count()) // output: 0
```

## Updating values

In order to update the value of a signal, you call the setter function returned by `createSignal`:

```jsx
setCount(count()+1)

console.log(count()) // output: 1
```

## Reactivity

Signals are reactive, which means that they automatically update whenever their value changes.
When a signal is called within a [tracking scope](/concepts/intro-to-reactivity#tracking), the signal adds the function to a list of dependencies.
Once a signal's value changes, it notifies all of its dependencies, which triggers the functions to update.

```jsx
function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(count() + 1)

	return (
		<div>
			<span>Count: {count()}</span> {/* Updates when `count` changes */}
			<button type="button" onClick={increment}>
				Increment
			</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

<Aside>
  A tracking scope is typically created by [`createEffect`](/reference/createEffect)  or [`createMemo`](/reference/createMemo), which are other Solid primitives. 
  Both functions subscribe to the signals accessed within them, establishing a dependency relationship.
