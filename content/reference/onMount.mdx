<Title>onMount</Title>

A lifecycle method used to register a function that runs when a component is rendered and the
elements have been mounted to the DOM.

Ideal for using [refs](/reference/ref) and managing other one-time setup that requires the 
component's elements to be mounted.

onMount will only run the funtion once after initial rendering is done and won't 
run on the server.

It's an alias for an effect that is non-tracking, meaning that it is equivalent to a 
[`createEffect`](/reference/createEffect) with no dependencies.

While it can be used to perform data fetching, it is best to use Solid's resources with 
[`createResource`](/reference/createResource) for that task.

### TypeScript Function Signature

```typescript
function onMount(fn: () => void): void;
```

### Example

Imagine we would like to attach an event listener to our window and listen to the resize event.
We only want to attach it once, so onMount will be helpful in this case.

```jsx
import { onMount } from "solid-js";

const handleResize = () => {
  //...
};

const App = () => {
  onMount(() => {
    window.addEventListner("resize", handleResize);
  });
};
```
