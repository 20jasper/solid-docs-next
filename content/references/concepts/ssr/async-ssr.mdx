<Title>Async SSR</Title>

## What is Async SSR?

Async SSR is a server side rendering technique used by most javascript meta-frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby, etc. It is a technique that allows you to completely render your application on the server and send the HTML to the client along with the appropriate asynchronous data already fetched. This allows the client to render the page without having to wait for the data to be fetched.

Solid.js offers a similar technique through the use of the `renderToStringAsync` function. This function allows you to render your application on the server and send the HTML to the client along with all the asynchronous data already fetched. This allows your application to be completely client agnostic and not have to worry about client side data fetching and hydration.

## How does `renderToStringAsync` work?

`renderToStringAsync` works by taking a component and returning a promise that resolves to a string of HTML. This string of HTML is the rendered component with all the asynchronous data already fetched and serialized into the HTML. Therefore, the whole application is already hydrated and ready to be rendered by the time it reaches the client.
