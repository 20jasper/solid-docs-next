<Title>Simple/Client-Fetching SSR</Title>

In this section we will discuss server side rendering, what it means, how Solid.js implements it, how to use it and it's limitations. 

## What is Server Side Rendering?

Server side rendering is simply the process of rendering your application on the server then sending the HTML to the client. This is opposed to the client rendering the application in their browser. Server side rendering has many benefits, but the most important one is that it allows search engines to crawl your application. This is because search engines can't run Javascript code, so if your application is rendered on the client(browser) then search engines will not be able to crawl your application.

## How does Solid.js implement SSR?

Solid.js implements SSR in 3 different ways depending on the type of application you are building. The 3 different ways are:

- `renderToString`: This is used to render a component to a string of HTML. 
- `renderToStringAsync`: This is used to render a component to a string of HTML asynchronously.
- `renderToStream`: This is used to render a component to a stream of HTML.
