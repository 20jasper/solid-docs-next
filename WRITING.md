## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in writing for Solid.

## Voice and tone

### Approachable

Modern documentation has shifted toward a less formal tone to great effect.
Good documents these days center on providing a friendly and approachable tone.
Solid would like to adopt this.
Of course, your contributions should still maintain a technical focus to provide the reader with the information that they're looking for.
We encourage you to pay attention to how [Google](https://developers.google.com/style/tone) defines a friendly tone.

> In your documents, aim for a voice and tone that's conversational, friendly, and respectful without being overly colloquial or frivolous; a voice that's casual and natural and approachable, not pedantic or pushy. Try to sound like a knowledgeable friend who understands what the developer wants to do.

### Accessible

### Inclusive

No contractions
