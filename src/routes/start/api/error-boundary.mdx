<Title>Error Boundary</Title>

The achilles heel of web apps seems to lie in error handling. An unhandled error in one component can bring your entire app down with it. Preferably, apps can be split into self-contained sections, where the failure of one component does not render the entire app unusable, only that one section.

Solid achieves this functionality with *Error Boundaries*. Error Boundary is a special component that ensures the unhandled errors of it's children don't extend beyond it's boundary. 

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "solid-start/error-boundary";

function Root() {
    return (<>
        <ErrorBoundary>
            <p>You can't see this text because of the error</p>
            {() => { throw new Error('Oh no! An error!') }}
        </ErrorBoundary>
        <p>But this text is still here!</p>
    </>)
}
```
