<Title>Routing & pages</Title>

Routing is the foundation of SolidStart. SolidStart uses the [Solid App Router](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-app-router) and enables _isomorphic routing_: the ability to write routes code once and have it work on both the server and client. In this section, you'll learn how to write basic routes, navigate between routes, and handle more complex/dynamic routing scenarios.

## Creating a route

SolidStart uses file system-based routing. This means that the directory path of your route files will translate exactly to the route structure in your application.

Here are a few examples of files in our directory structure and how they would translate to application routes:

- `/src/root/index.tsx` -> mysite.com
- `/src/root/admin/index.tsx` -> mysite.com/admin
- `/src/root/admin/edit-settings.tsx` -> mysite.com/admin/edit-settings

Under the hood, SolidStart is able to traverse this directory structure, automatically collect all the routes, and populate the `<Routes />` component in the `src/root.tsx` file. This means that creating a route in your directory structure makes it immediately available to visit in your application!

### Route file structure

Each route file should export a default component. This component represents the content that will be rendered when users visit the route:

```tsx
export default function Index() {
  return <div>Welcome to SolidStart!</div>;
}
```

- Opinionated, file system-based Routing
  - Show `Routes` import in `root.tsx`
  - Export default component, export named `routeData` function
  - Explain how this equates to inline routing you would have written by hand

## Nested route relationships

## Navigating between routes

- How to link between pages (`a` tags, `Link`, `NavLink`)

## Redirecting

- Redirecting with `<Navigate />` (works on client and server)

## Creating dynamic routes

- Search query params (not sure yet optimal API for this)

- Instructions for creating basic pages
- Nested routes (e.g., `auth.tsx` vs `auth/login.tsx`)
  - Talk about using route data function in parent route
- Catch-all/404 pages

## Dynamic routes

- Pages with route parameters
  - File naming, accessing route params
- routeData, accessing parent route data
  - Throwing in route data

## Status codes, headers, and other parts of the response

HTTP responses from the server don't just include the HTML body! SolidStart handles status codes and headers automatically, but gives you a few different ways to change the default values for these if necessary. [**Note:** mechanism for handling this is WIP, update when ready]
