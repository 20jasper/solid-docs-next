- Redirecting with `<Navigate />` (works on client and server)
- Takes care of status codes, cache headers with page response (but you can edit these)
- How to link between pages (`a` tags, `Link`, `NavLink`)
- Search query params (not sure yet optimal API for this)

- Opinionated, file system-based Routing
  - Show `Routes` import in `root.tsx`
  - Export default component, export named `routeData` function
  - Explain how this equates to inline routing you would have written by hand
- Instructions for creating basic pages

  - Talk about using route data function in parent route
- Catch-all/404 pages
