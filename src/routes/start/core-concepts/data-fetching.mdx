<title>Data fetching</title>

# Data fetching

- Short `createResource` recap
- Fetching data from your backend (using `server` function) (`server` is becoming a low-level API that might not commonly be used)
  - how this works on server vs. client
  - Usage with routeData
  - using `Suspense` (how this works normally vs. streaming)
- Fetching data from another site

Potential New APIs

- `createRouteResource` (new API) - when an action submits successfully, route resources refetch
- `createServerResource` might subsume `server`
- `createServerAction` (for TBD actions section)
