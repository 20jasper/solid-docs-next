# Data fetching

- Why we need to use `routeData`: Render-as-you-fetch pattern, start fetching data as your component is rendering

- Short `createResource` recap

- how this works on server vs. client
- Usage with routeData
- using `Suspense` (how this works normally vs. streaming)

- Top level Suspense required for async rendering to fetch things on the server

- ErrorBoundary catching errors from resources (important part is where you access the resource not where its declared)

- `createServerData`
  - if you want the data to be fetched and processed on the server always
  - if you want to use your database in a safe way, do it on the server inside `createServerData`

- if you want data from a SolidStart API route in your component, use `server.fetch('/api/hello')`
- if you want data from an external API in your component, use same old `fetch('api.com/api/hello')`
