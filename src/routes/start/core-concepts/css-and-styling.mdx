<Title>CSS and Syling</Title>

Some frameworks modify the behavior of the [`<style>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style) tags, however as a standards based framework, instead of modifying behavior, we strive to build ontop of it.

## Styling components

[Vite provides](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) a simple way to manage CSS for a complex web app by allowing users to import CSS using ESM syntax anywhere in the component tree. One possible architecture is to write CSS in a file accompanying your component file.

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   ├── Button.css
```

Let's suppose we want to color the buttons in our component blue. We can style the button in the normal way:

```css
button {
  background-color: #446b9e;
}
```

And then import our CSS file in the component:

```tsx
import "./Button.css"
function Button(props) {
  return (<button>{props.text}</button>)
}

```
You may notice that the CSS you just imported is _global_. This means that all buttons (not just the ones created via this component) will be blue!

In many cases, global CSS is not the intended behavior. One simple solution is to make use of CSS features like [class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors). Typically, this would involve adding a class to the root element, and then updating each CSS rule to use a child selector. This works excellent for a small component, but for a complex one, adding a child selector to each CSS rule for the component can get tedious.

```css
div.card {
  background-color: #446b9e;
}
div.card > h1 {}
div.card > p {}
```

### Getting sassy

The easiest mitigation for this pitfall is to utilize the power of [SCSS/Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables). SCSS adds many zero cost CSS abstractions. [Vite has first class support for pre-processors](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors), so to use SCSS files, simply run:

```bash
npm add -D sass
```

Then change the extension from `.css` to `.scss` and update your imports accordingly.

With SCSS, you can simplify the process of styling a component by nesting rules

```scss
div.card {
  background-color: #446b9e;
  h1 {}
  p {}
}
```

- can use tailwind etc

- SSR CSS and using some CSS-in-js solution that requires you to render the stylesheet separately and add it to the HTML before sending it to client
  - try to use https://github.com/solidjs/solid-styled-components as an example
