# Assets, metadata, and CSS

- Fill up head in `root.tsx` (e.g., favicon)
  - Links, Meta, Scripts components (people won't be removing these)
- populate `head` section dynamically with `solid-meta`
- Talk about vite and using CSS by importing it, can use tailwind etc
- Assets describe how can include files in `/public` or import files as path
  - Look into difference and prescribe when to do each
