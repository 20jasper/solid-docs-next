<title>Motivation & goals</title>

# Motivation

- Brief history from server rendering -> CSR -> SSG -> Meta frameworks (e.g., Next.js)
- Wanted to make a meta framework for Solid.js that works across the stack

# Goals

1. Fine-grained reactivity with Solid
2. Writing isomorphic code

- Give users a bunch of levers to write SSR, CSR, and SSG with the same code
- Consistent mental models across the front-end/backend spectrum
- APIs that make sense for SSR, SSG, and CSR

3. Handle bundling and routing behind the scenes
4. Opinionated patterns where they make sense (e.g., file system-based routing)
