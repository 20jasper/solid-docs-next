## Using a starter (recommended)

To create your first SolidStart application, create a directory, change into that directory, and run `npm init solid`.

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npm init solid
```

You will get a list of templates from which to choose. You can view the code for each of these options in the [SolidStart Github repository](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples).

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   bare
    hackernews
    with-auth
    with-mdx
    with-tailwindcss
    with-vitest
```

Next, you'll be asked whether to use Server Side Rendering and Typescript. Choose your desired options to continue.

Now that the appropriate template has downloaded, you can install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Your app is now set up! You can run it loally by running

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running locally on port 3000. You can view it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
