<title>Building User Interfaces with Components</title>

# Building User Interfaces with Components

## What are components?

Components are functions that define how your application looks. Each component you write represents a small part of your application's entire user interface. Splitting your application into components has many advantages: components are modular bits of code, are reusable, easily tested, and enable team members to work on different parts of the app simultaneously.

Let's build our first component. This component will display `Hello World!` inside a `<div>` element. To do this, we need to create a file called "HelloWorld" inside our src folder. Start by choosing a language base to write in (`.jsx` or `.tsx` - if you're not sure, create `HelloWorld.jsx`). Then copy the following contents:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.jsx", component: HelloWorld }],
    tsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.tsx", component: HelloWorld }],
  }}
/>

There are a couple of things to note in our first component:

- Our component name, `HelloWorld`, is title-cased (sometimes referred to as _Pascal_ case). This is intentional and we'll discuss this convention shortly.
- Our component returns something that looks a lot like HTML, but isn't&mdash;it's _JSX_.

<FrameworkAside framework="react">

While Solid components look like React components, they differ in a few distinct ways. Solid component functions _only run once_ to set up and never run again. If you're used to placing a calculation in the function body of a React component and expecting it to recompute when the component re-renders, you may need to take a different approach with Solid. Don't worry&mdash; we'll cover all the best practices throughout this tutorial.

</FrameworkAside>

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">

In Vue, components have _lifecycles_ that are important to how you work with them. In Solid, components are functions that "modulate" your code and rely on "reactivity" built within Solid&mdash; we'll get to that!
A few points: Solid's rendering system doesn't create boundaries for your components and doesn't care about Single File Components. You can include as many components as you like within a file. You can even write a component _inside_ of another!

In Svelte, components have _lifecycles_ that are important to how you work with them. In Solid, components are functions that "modulate" your code and rely on "reactivity" built within Solid&mdash; we'll get to that!

<FrameworkAside framework="angular">

In Angular, components have _lifecycles_ that are important to how you work with
them. In Solid, components are simply functions that group your code. They
don't have lifecycles, and Solid's rendering system isn't based on the
boundaries of your components but on the reactive features you use&mdash;we'll get
to that! Another thing to note: While you're able to write multiple Angular components
in the same file using the `template` component decorator property, Solid takes it
to another level.
In Solid, not only can you can include as many components as you like
within a file, you can even write a component _inside_ of another!

</FrameworkAside>
## What is JSX?

As we learned above, Solid components return JSX. JSX is an HTML-like syntax used in Solid JavaScript code to represent part of the Document Object Model (DOM). In our HelloWorld.jsx example above, we returned the following JSX from our component:

```tsx
<div>Hello World!</div>
```

This JSX represents a `<div>` element with the text `Hello World!` inside. It's just as if we had written it in an HTML document.
As a means of showing you the power and flexibility of Solid, let's add some inline styling to our `<div>`:

```tsx
<div style="background-color: #2c4f7c; color: #FFF;">Hello world!</div>
```

This will render a div with a blue background color and white text:

<div style="background-color: #2c4f7c; color: #FFF;">Hello world!</div>

This syntax is already a big win. Trying to create a stylized div using JavaScript _without_ JSX would be more complex:

```ts
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.style["background-color"] = "#2c4f7c";
div.style.color = "#FFF";
```

<Aside>
  In a real app, you'd want to use CSS instead of inline styles; this is just
  for demo purposes.
</Aside>

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
  Vue has its own "template language" in a designated file type called `.vue`.
  `.jsx` serves a similar role in Solid, but isn't directly integrated into
  JavaScript. We can write a JSX element anywhere we could write a JavaScript
  expression, and there's no enforced separation between template and data.

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">

<FrameworkAside framework="angular">
  Instead of JSX, Angular has its own "template compiler" that takes template
  strings and compiles them into JavaScript instructions. This serves a similar
  role to JSX, but isn't directly integrated into JavaScript. In Solid, you can

  there's no enforced separation between template and data.
</FrameworkAside>

### JSX + JavaScript

JSX becomes even more powerful when used alongside JavaScript expressions. For example, we can use variables to represent some of the text content in our `<div>`:

```tsx
const name = "Solid";

<div style="background-color: #2c4f7c; color: #FFF;">Hello {name}!</div>;
```

Notice how we can add `{name}` where it used to say `World`. This JavaScript expression allows us to modify the content of our `<div>`:

<div style="background-color: #2c4f7c; color: #FFF;">Hello Solid!</div>

We can take this a step further and specify our div's `{style}` attribute as a JavaScript object:

```tsx
const name = "Solid";
const style = { "background-color": "#2c4f7c", color: "#FFF" };

<div style={style}>Hello {name}!</div>;
```

With JSx, we have code that lets us take advantage of the dynamic nature of JavaScript with a declarative HTML-like syntax.

As we progress through these tutorials, we'll discover how Solid's reactive system combines with JSX to improve the experience of crafting user interfaces.

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">

This syntax of binding HTML and attribute values are two different syntaxes in Vue. The above might look something like this in Vue:

```html
<div :style="style">Hello {{name}}!</div>
```

</FrameworkAside>

### Using custom components in JSX

Let's update our initial `HelloWorld` component with what we learned in our JSX exploration:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.jsx", component: HelloWorld2 }],
    tsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.tsx", component: HelloWorld2 }],
  }}
/>

We can now use `HelloWorld` inside another component. Import it in `App.jsx` by adding the line:
`import { HelloWorld } from "./HelloWorld";` to the top of the file.

Then, use it by inserting `<HelloWorld />` below the `<h1>Welcome</h1>` header.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App },
      { name: "HelloWorld.jsx", component: HelloWorld2 },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App },
      { name: "HelloWorld.tsx", component: HelloWorld2 },
    ],
  }}
/>

Take a moment to think about what we gain from this. `MyApp` is a function built with the `<HelloWorld />` function.

<Aside>
  By building with components, we are able to keep our codebase DRY (Don't
  Repeat Yourself). Components provide flexibility and reusability. They let us
  create building blocks that we can put together to form new pieces.
</Aside>

### Using fragments

One rule when using JSX is that JSX must return a single element. For example, the following is valid JSX because there is a single `<div />` that contains the rest of the JSX:

```tsx
<div>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <HelloWorld />
</div>
```

But the following is _not_ valid JSX because there is no single containing element:

```tsx
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<HelloWorld />
```

However, we may not actually _want_ a `<div />` (or some other element) surrounding this code when it's rendered to the DOM. _JSX fragments_ give us a way to both write valid JSX and also not actually render a containing element to the DOM. Fragments look like `<></>` and can be used like other JSX components:

```tsx
<>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <HelloWorld />
</>
```

Now we have valid JSX but we won't have a containing element rendered to the DOM.

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
  Vue 2 worked similarly: a component needed to have a single root element.
</FrameworkAside>

<FrameworkAside framework="angular">
  Angular has a similar API to Fragments with
  [`ng-container`](https://angular.io/api/core/ng-container).
</FrameworkAside>

### JSX is compiled

JSX is syntax on top of JavaScript and is not directly part of any JavaScript standard. Therefore, JSX can't be run directly in the browser (or most other JavaScript runtimes). Solid and other frameworks that use JSX require their code to be run through a compiler. If you're using a starter template you probably don't have to worry about this&mdash;everything will just work out of the box.

**Note:** Remember how we discussed that component function names are title-cased? This is so the compiler understands the difference between native DOM elements (like `div`) and custom components (like `HelloWorld`).

## Mounting Solid to the DOM

While we have been talking about components and JSX, we haven't covered an important topic: how our components make it into the actual HTML page that we show our users.

To add a Solid application to an HTML document, we want to make sure we have an element inside which we want our application to render. In this example, we want our Solid app to render inside a `div` that has an `id` of `"root"`.

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
```

Solid provides a `render` function that will render our app inside this `div`:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.jsx", component: HelloWorld3 }],
    tsx: [{ name: "HelloWorld.tsx", component: HelloWorld3 }],
  }}
/>

This snippet creates our `HelloWorld` component, checks to see if our root node exists, and inserts within that DOM node. At this point, we have built a representation of our user interface in JavaScript and Solid has added it to the DOM: everything needed for us to see our simple Hello World application on a web page!

**Note:** The `render` function is also doing some magic behind the scenes that enables Solid's _reactive system_, so you'll want to make sure the first argument passed to the render function is a function that returns a component `() => <Component />` rather than just the component itself.

<FrameworkAside framework="react">

React defaults to having a `StrictMode` component added to the root of your app, which [changes the render behavior of your code depending on whether you're in a development mode or not](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/keeping-components-pure#side-effects-unintended-consequences:~:text=Detecting%20impure%20calculations%20with%20StrictMode).

Solid has no such behavioral differences between production and development rendering.

</FrameworkAside>

## Composing multiple components together

In most cases, our applications are big enough that we will want to split them into _multiple_ components. Let's move on from our `HelloWorld` example to build something a little bigger&mdash;a virtual bookshelf. Our bookshelf will allow us to add books, mark books as "read", and eventually fetch book titles from other services on the Internet.

Given the intuitive nature of JSX, we can plan out our application a bit. Our main `Bookshelf` will comprise two top-level components:

- A `<BookList />` component, which lists all the books in our bookshelf
- An `<AddBook />` component, which will allow us to add a book to our bookshelf

While we'll eventually want to make our bookshelf interactive, let's first create non-interactive versions of each component. First, we can make the `BookList` component inside and list a couple of books alongside their authors:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 }],
    tsx: [{ name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 }],
  }}
/>

Next, we create an `AddBook` component. This will be a form that eventually allows us to add a book to our `BookList` list.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
  }}
/>

Finally, we can _compose_ our `BookList` and `AddBook` components together inside our `Bookshelf` app.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App1 },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App1 },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
  }}
/>

### Component relationships

There are a couple of terms worth learning when we talk about how components relate to one another&mdash;_parent_ and _child_. In our `Bookshelf` example, the `Bookshelf` component is called the _parent_ of both `BookList` and `AddBook` because those two components are within `Bookshelf`. Accordingly, `BookList` and `AddBook` are _children_ of `Bookshelf`. You may already be familiar with this terminology; it's how we tend to refer to HTML element relationships in our DOM tree.

### Passing props between components

Components can communicate with their child components by passing properties, often shortened to `props`. To demonstrate the power of `props`, let's customize the bookshelf by adding your name! In the example below, we update the app to display "Solid's Bookshelf," but you should use your name.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
  }}
/>

<FrameworkAside framework="react">

In React, it's common to use _destructuring assignment_ when accessing props inside a component. For example, our `Bookshelf` component may be written like this in React:

```tsx
function Bookshelf({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}'s Bookshelf</h1>
      <Books />
      <AddBook />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**But destructuring `props` is usually a bad idea in Solid**. Under the hood, Solid uses _proxies_ to hook into `props` objects to know when a prop is accessed. When we destructure our props object in the function signature, we immediately access the object's properties and lose reactivity.

</FrameworkAside>

### Progress!

Thus far, we learned about Solid components, JSX, and built the foundation of a handy bookshelf app. Next, we'll bring our bookshelf to life using Solid's reactive system!
